Where to start. As with any Detroit sports team, we love them, we hate them, we named our dogs after them (my childhood family dog was named Cecil [Fielder]). I have always been a baseball fan, I don&#39;t particularly like any other sports, but baseball always did it for me. Once I got a little older and discovered beer, this whole baseball thing seemed to make that much more sense.\n\nNow, I&#39;m not sure who authorized it, but when the Tiger&#39;s redid their logo to its currenty design, I wanted to punch something. Compared to this throwback design, that logo just sucks. The story behind this print is that we were asked to do a series of jerseys for this totally awesome event hosted in Detroit in mid September called &quot;Another Detroit is Happening&quot;. Check them out, they&#39;re doing good stuff, making Detroit not Suck if you will.\n\nPrinted on a black crewneck sweatshirt, shits soft, shits warm, like a batch of freshly baked cookies but I wouldn&#39;t suggest eating it unless that&#39;s your thing.\n\nAvailable in XS-2XL -- (extra small is a youth large, it shares the same size specs that an adult XS would have, but this style of shirt is not available in a true adult XS, message if you have any other questions)\n\nGET IT","creation_tsz":1444311221,"ending_tsz":1454942021,"original_creation_tsz":1382296862,"last_modified_tsz":1444311221,"price":"25.50","currency_code":"USD","quantity":88,"tags":["detroit tigers","80s logo","vintage detroit","vintage logo","throwback logo","baseball shirt","vintage tigers","detroit shirt","tigers logo","detroit tigers logo","old tigers logo","old school tigers","throwback tigers"],"category_path":["Clothing","Hoodie"],"category_path_ids":[69150353,69152975],"materials":["ringer shirt","ringspun cotton","silk screen","screen print","silkscreen","screenprint","sweatshirt","crewneck sweatshirt","black sweatshirt","black crew sweatshirt"],"shop_section_id":12229451,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1411241441,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/166410849\/vintage-80s-detroit-tigers-logo-black?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":882,"num_favorers":60,"shipping_template_id":6917476436,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":1,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":"birthday","style":["Traditional","Hipster"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":2202,"taxonomy_path":["Clothing","Unisex Adult Clothing","Hoodies & Sweatshirts","Sweatshirts"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":515240020,"hex_code":"5D5E61","red":93,"green":94,"blue":97,"hue":225,"saturation":4,"brightness":38,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1382296862,"listing_id":166410849,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/035\/1\/6276524\/il_75x75.515240020_gvgu.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/035\/1\/6276524\/il_170x135.515240020_gvgu.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/035\/1\/6276524\/il_570xN.515240020_gvgu.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/035\/1\/6276524\/il_fullxfull.515240020_gvgu.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1301}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6276524,"shop_name":"wethouse","user_id":14257508,"creation_tsz":1301388757,"title":"WET HOUSE","announcement":"--&gt;&gt; Click for more info --&gt;&gt; THANKS!

We will have your item(s) ready to pick up and will refund you on your shipping. \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve put the size charts up to accompany most items now, if you have any more questions about sizing don&#39;t hesitate to ask. We use American Apparel & Bella+Canvas. Please understand that we&#39;re set up to run efficiently with a 2-3 day lead time on most orders, if you request a custom item or something that we don&#39;t typically stock - that lead time might increase by a few days.

Felt strips are also applied to the bottoms of the stands so they won&#39;t damage your desk or shelf.  They are designed to be small so they won&#39;t detract from the main piece, your bat.

Your item will not mount to the wall, and will look like the first two pictured, only painted.  \n\nPlease be sure to select the color for the rack as well as the color for the felt.

Any of the pieces shown can also be made using a baseball you provide, so if you have a baseball that is special to you or someone you love, I can make it into something you  can see and share with others every day. Depending on which design you choose, I can often take a small enough piece out of the ball so that the ball can still be displayed in a cube and the removed area is not visible. \r\n\r\nFor more information on specific requests, custom orders or anything else, please contact me directly by clicking &quot;Contact Shop Owner&quot; (under the Shop Owner section to the left of the page) or the &quot;Ask a Question&quot; link on any item listing page.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1403411624,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/ArtOfLeftField?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/036\/0\/9536239\/iusb_760x100.13934182_bz14.jpg","num_favorers":45,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/076\/0\/9536239\/isla_fullxfull.16004686_hidgsz3d.jpg"}},{"listing_id":228648616,"state":"active","user_id":41859006,"category_id":69181971,"title":"Chicago Cubs Bodysuit for Baby Girl 2","description":"This royal blue onesie is appliqued with a baseball, bearing the modified Cubs logo in red with tiny white hearts and blue satin.
